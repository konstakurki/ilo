<h1>Timeline of Technology continues</h1>

<p>The list looks ridiculous, so let’s print it another way. In the following every linebreak represents 1% change towards the year 2056, which makes length of the list only 5% of the one-line-one-year list. (Smaller font and line height compress it even further.) The first linebreaks are steps of approximately 120 years.</p>

THE PRESENT (2018)</code></pre>

<p style='font-size:400%;background-color:red;padding-left:15px;font-weight:bold;'>The list ends here.</P>


<p>Now the inventions seem to be distributed more or less evenly. The last linebreaks are steps of four months or so, while the first linebreaks were leaps of 360 times greater length. It would take about 100 lines to reach the year 2042. The year 2056 would be infinitely far below, which is why it is called a singularity.</p>

<p>Of course 2056 is just my choice. It’s a fun choice, because artificial neural networks—which are the dominant approach to artificial intelligence nowadays—<a href='http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html'>seem to hit</a> the human brain size of 10<sup>11</sup> neurons that year<!--—although I’m a little skeptical about that myself-->, assuming that network sizes continue to double regularly<!--, that is, they continue to grow exponentially in time-->. That’s a reasonable assumption, since the cost of computation <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/31409423572/'>has halved every two years</a> since 1900.</p>

<p>This “Moore’s law” or “The Law of Cost Gravity” seems to hold somewhat generally. The first hard disk drive, the IBM 350, held about 5MB of data and was 60 inches long, 68 inches and 29 inches deep in 1956. Now, as flash memory is replacing hard disk drives, a tiny MicroSD card can hold 512GB of data. In other words, data storage capacity per volume has doubled every 1.5 years since IBM 350. Extrapolating this trend, in 2056 one cubic millimeter will hold 100,000 terabytes of data, enough for storing a sharp and detailed picture of every human being on Earth. That’s something like one bit per every 10,000 atoms, so it sounds feasible.</p>

<p>For laser printing the average cost gravity on the period 1984&ndash;2011 <a href='http://hintjens.com/blog:29'>was 29% per year</a>. In 1998 the dominant way to access Internet was 56 kbit/s dial-up modem, and doubling that every two years makes 56 Mbit/s in 2018, a speed easily surpassed by smartphone 4G connections. In 2056 that’ll be 28,000 Gbit/s. A moderate estimate for general cost gravity is halving of price or doubling of performance every two years, which means a change by a factor of 500,000 by 2056.</p>

<p>Regular doubling, or exponential growth, means that the rate of change is proportional to the current state of affairs. This is qualitatively true for technology: the more advanced technology we have, the faster we can make improvements. Folding of paper demonstrates, though only in our imagination, exponential growth: it would take 30&ndash;40 foldings to make any paper so thick that it’s upper side would be as high as the orbit of the Moon. Only about seven foldings are possible in practice.</p>

<p>There are also more concrete signs of the forthcoming singularity. Before the introduction of iPhone 11 years ago, almost no one had a smartphone. Now almost everybody has one. Smart watches and Google glasses are booming. Washing machines, light bulbs and dog collars are gaining access to Internet. Soon every human, pet animal, tool and piece of furniture will be digitally connected to each other 24/7. Distance, privacy and lack of information will disappear completely.</p>

<p>Robots are surpassing humans on every task worth money. They make cancer diagnoses, trade stocks and drive cars better than us. The only reason why cars still need human drivers is politics and public distrust. Machines serve us like a slave human: you can talk to and get spoken answers from Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.</p>

<p>To put these together, in 2056:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have completely lost track of how many internet devices there are around us. The number may be a hundred or a thousand, or 500,000 devices per each human being. A large portion of them are equipped with a camera and a microphone.</li>
<li>Every moment of every human being is recorded with cameras, microphones and body sensors. People can’t control this, because they don’t know what monitoring devices are around. People monitor each other for hostile and defensive purposes.</li>
<li>There will be no place on Earth with no high-speed internet connection. The only thing that limits available information is politics.</li>
<li>Robots take care of every routine task, both mechanical and intellectual. Humans can do whatever they want with their time. There is no need to move away from home, or bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is the essence of the singularity.</p>


<!--. The important thing is that the evolution of technology is exploding right now and is leading to something unforeseen in the next few decades.</p>-->

<h1>Timeline of Technology continues</h1>

<p>The list looks ridiculous, so let’s print it another way. In the following every linebreak represents 1% change towards the year 2056, which makes length of the list only 5% of the one-line-one-year list. The first linebreaks are steps of approximately 120 years.</p>

THE PRESENT (2018)</code></pre>

<p>Now the inventions seem to be distributed more or less evenly. The last linebreaks are steps of four months or so, while the first linebreaks were leaps of 360 times greater length. It would take about 100 lines to reach the year 2042. The year 2056 would be infinitely far below, which is why it is called a singularity.</p>

<p>Of course 2056 is just my choice. It’s a fun choice, because artificial neural networks <a href='http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html'>seem to hit</a> the human brain size of 10<sup>11</sup> neurons that year—although I’m a little skeptical about that myself. The important thing is that the evolution of technology is exploding right now and is leading to something unforeseen in the next few decades.</p>

<p>The forecast of artificial neural nets hitting human brain size is based on the assumption that network sizes continue to double regularly, that is, they continue to grow exponentially in time. That’s a reasonable assumption, since the cost of computation <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/31409423572/'>have halved every two years</a> since 1900. This “Moore’s law” or “The Law of Cost Gravity” seems to hold somewhat generally, like for <a href='http://hintjens.com/blog:29'>for laser printing</a>. My skepticism stems from that the transistor size of processors is starting to hit the size of an atom, yet it is possible that some new technologies aads.</p>

<p>Exponential evolution means that the rate of change is proportional to the current state. This is qualitatively true for technology: the more advanced technology we have, the faster we can make improvements. In this light Moore’s law is no mystery.

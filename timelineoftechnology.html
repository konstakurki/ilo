<h1>Singularity 2056</h1>

<h2>Introduction: Timeline of Technology</h2>

<p>Stone tools date three million years back in time. They are 250 times as old as agriculture, and agriculture is 250 times as old as pocket calculator.</p>

<p>Since it’s difficult to grasp accelerating development like this, I’ve made a list of 169 important inventions that spans 12,000 years from the rise of agriculture to this day. If this was a traditional book, made readable by the printing press technology of the fifteenth century, it wouldn’t be practical to print the list in scale. But this is a digital book, rendered visible by computer-age inventions.</p>

<p>So every line represents one year, and there are a lot of empty lines between the inventions. Please scroll down fast. (It is also possible to <a href='#skipthelist'>skip</a> the list.) Here it comes.</p>

<p>The list looks ridiculous, so let’s print it another way. In the following every linebreak represents 1% change towards the year 2056, which makes length of the list only 5% of the one-line-one-year list. The first linebreaks are steps of approximately 120 years.</p>

THE PRESENT (2018)</code></pre>


<p>Now the inventions seem to be distributed more or less uniformly. The last linebreaks are steps of four months or so<!--, while the first linebreaks were leaps of 360 times greater length-->, and it would take about a hundred lines to reach the year 2042. The year 2056 would be infinitely far below; in other words, it is a singularity.</p>

<p>Of course 2056 is just my choice. It’s a fun choice, because artificial neural networks—which are the dominant approach to artificial intelligence nowadays—<a href='http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html'>seem to hit</a> the human brain size of 10<sup>11</sup> neurons that year<!--—although I’m a little skeptical about that myself-->, assuming that network sizes continue to double regularly<!--, that is, they continue to grow exponentially in time-->. That’s a reasonable assumption, since the monetary cost of computation <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/31409423572/'>has halved every two years</a> since 1900.</p>

<p>This “Moore’s law” or “The Law of Cost Gravity” seems to hold somewhat generally.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first hard disk drive, the IBM 350, held about 5 MB of data and was 60 inches long, 68 inches and 29 inches deep in 1956. Now, as flash memory is replacing hard disk drives, a tiny MicroSD card can hold 512 GB of data. On average the data storage capacity per volume has doubled every 1.5 years since IBM 350. Extrapolating this trend, in 2056 one cubic millimeter will hold 100,000 terabytes of data, enough for storing a sharp and detailed picture of every human being on Earth. There would still be something like 10,000 atoms per every bit of data in that cubic millimeter, so it sounds feasible.</li>
<li>In 1998 the dominant way to access Internet was 56 kbit/s dial-up modem. Doubling that every two years gives 56 Mbit/s in 2018, a speed easily surpassed by optical fiber and also smartphone 4G connections. In 2056 it will be 28,000 Gbit/s.</li>
<li>The cost of laser printing <a href='http://hintjens.com/blog:29'>halved every two years</a> during the period 1984&ndash;2011.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks that a moderate estimate for general cost gravity of sophisticated technology is halving of price or doubling of performance every two years. It means a change by a factor of 500,000 by 2056. Compare one second to one week.</p>

<!--<p>Regular doubling, or exponential growth, means that the rate of change is proportional to the current state of affairs. This is qualitatively true for technology: the more advanced technology we have, the faster we can make improvements. Moore’s law is just what we could expect to find.</p>

<p>Folding of paper demonstrates, though only in our imagination, exponential growth: it would take 30&ndash;40 foldings to make any paper so thick that it’s upper side would be as high as the orbit of the Moon. Only seven or so foldings are possible in practice.</p>-->

<p>There are also more concrete signs of the forthcoming singularity. Before the introduction of iPhone 11 years ago, almost no one had a smartphone. Now almost everybody has one. Washing machines, light bulbs and dog collars are gaining access to Internet. Soon every human, pet animal, tool and piece of furniture will be digitally connected to each other 24/7.</p>

<p>Robots are surpassing humans on every task worth money. They make cancer diagnoses more accurately, trade stocks more profitably and drive cars safer than we do. The only reason why cars still need human drivers is politics and public distrust. Machines serve us like a slave human: you can talk to and get spoken answers from Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.</p>

<p>To put these together, in 2056:</p>

<ul>
<li>There will be no place on Earth without high-speed internet connection available. We have completely lost track of how many internet devices there are around us. The number may be a hundred or a thousand, or 500 thousand devices per each human being.<!-- A large portion of them are equipped with a camera and a microphone.--></li>
<li>Data is being fed constantly into our brains. It doesn’t matter whether it’s via brain implants or displays and headphones—the only thing that matters is bandwidth, which exceeds the human capability to receive information.</li>
<li>Every moment of every human life is recorded with cameras, microphones and body sensors—not to mention computer usage logging. Deep and subtle aspects of thoughts and feelings are mined from this mass of data. Machines know what we want, could want and don’t want, so we don’t need to.</li>
<!--<li>People don’t control this, because they don’t know what monitoring devices are around. People monitor each other for hostile and defensive purposes.</li>-->
<li>Robots take care of every routine task, both mechanical and intellectual. Humans can do whatever they want with their time, and there is no need to move away from home or bed (except when the authorities enforce penal servitude).</li>
</ul>

 <!--Those who have the biggest data and the most powerful mining algorithms rule the world.</li>
for the tasks the ones in control demand from the people.</li>
<li>What humans want is forged by the knowledge mined from the data.</li>
<li>More and more people see this </li>
</ul>-->

<p>That is the essence of the singularity. The big question is, what kind of impact it will have on human life? There is also a mysterious theory about the singularity, according to which a robot with superhuman intelligence will emerge and develop even more intelligent robot and so on, creating an intelligence explosion. Is there any truth in that?</p>

<p>I think that the answers are “lethal” and “no.” I’ll try to explain why.</p>

<!--<p>The word “singularity” is perhaps better known in the context of black holes. According to the theory of relativity, there is a singularity in the center of the black hole, which is a point in space and time at which their curvature, and also the strength of gravity, become infinite. However, it is believed that no real singularity of infinite curvature occurs, and that the apparent singularity is due to the incompleteness of the general theory of relativity.</p>-->


<!--. The important thing is that the evolution of technology is exploding right now and is leading to something unforeseen in the next few decades.</p>-->
